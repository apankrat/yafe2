This is a re-incarnation of [yet another fractal explorer](http://swapped.cc/yafe) (yafe)
that adds support for parallel, multithread rendering on multi-
core machines and support for distributed rendering over the 
network of participating 'worker' instances.

Primarily meant for exploring Lyapunov fractals, which still
remain as computationally expensive as they are [intriguing](http://swapped.cc/content/yafe/img/lyapunov-2048-thumb-bw.png).

Work very much in progress.
