This is a re-incarnation of [yet another fractal explorer](http://swapped.cc/yafe) (yafe)
that adds support for parallel, multithread rendering on multi-
core machines and support for distributed rendering over the 
network of participating 'worker' instances. Primarily meant for 
exploring Lyapunov fractals, which still remain as computationally 
expensive as they are [intriguing looking](http://swapped.cc/content/yafe/img/lyapunov-2048-thumb-bw.png).

WARNING - A pet project. Work very much in progress.
